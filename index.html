    <h1>Hello from the other side</h1>
    <h3>from whom? from "TONMOY"</h3>

<div class="first-paragraph">
  <p><b style="color:#ff931e; font-size:35px;">H</b>ello again, this is <em>S M Tonmoy</em>, born in 1988, zodiac: Libra (very important to know, [Kidding]). Anyway, after completing my BBA from United International University in 2010, I have started my service life in Incepta Pharmaceutical Ltd.
  First, I have served Project department as an Assistant Officer, then I got transferred to Finance & Accounts department. Here I got the opportunity to serve for Accounts Receivables and Treasury functions. Along with that and I have also served as CTM (Core Team Member) of SD (Sales and Distribution) module in SAP (Systems, Applications, Products in data processing).
  Let’s not bore you with more details or with my job responsibilities. If you have gone through the last lines then you have noticed, I have used the word "serve" several times. It means in service life you are bound to serve for others. After my 9.5 years, I have realized it in 2019 and draw an end line in my service carrier on 30th July 2019 and trying to go for a startup of my own.
  I am not saying service is not a good thing, rather it makes you disciplined, gives you lots of experience, teach you how to be more patience. But everything has its own opportunity cost and here the cost is your freedom, your decision-making ability.

<p>The report was based on a sample of the more than 300,000 freelancers in Payoneer's network.</p>
<p>Sixth annual “Freelancing in America” study finds that more people than ever see freelancing as a long-term career path</p>
<div class="bold">
<p>>Freelancing income exceeds GDP of some major industries: At nearly $1 trillion (approaching 5% of U.S. GDP), freelance income contributes more to the economy than industries such as construction and transportation and is on par with the information sector. Freelancers doing skilled services earn a median rate of $28 an hour, earning more per hour than 70 percent of workers in the overall U.S. economy</p>
<p>>Freelancing is becoming more of a long-term career choice: For the first time, as many freelancers said they view this way of working as a long-term career choice as they do a temporary way to make money. In addition, the share of those who freelance full time increased from 17% in 2014 to 28% this year.</p>
<p>>Freelancers are most likely to be skilled professionals - Skilled services are the most common type of freelance work, with 45% of freelancers providing skills such as programming, marketing, IT and business consulting. </p>
